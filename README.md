# Team_Profile_Generator

## Description

This application creates an team employee profile. Through the use of node.js, a user will be
able to enter in employee's information to create an webpage that displays their information.

## Progress
Currently, the project is in development. The inquirer prompts are created and enough HTML is written to produce a file that is able to represent a mvp. However, using an object class is currently being researched and also passing the values to the application seems to have created a few errors. Once the flow is properly assessed, the application should be fully functional.

#Update

This application now has the ability to generate a manager profile, engineer and intern card for the a team porfolio website.
